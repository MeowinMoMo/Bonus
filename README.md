The game is called Looking for Umi in thought of a friend I've met
The game is your basic 2d platformer game where player is named Booni and goes on an adventure looking for Umi
There are 2 endings to the game and I wish I knew more about trigger points for some parts but it was fine
If you are stuck the reset button is around to help you
